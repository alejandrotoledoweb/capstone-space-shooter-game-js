# Capstone-space-shooter-game-js

I built this game as part of the Final Project for JavaScript Section at Full-Stack Developer Programm at Microverse School. This is a full JavaScript app about a space shooter game.
I implemented this game using Phaser 3 as the main dependency for the game.
The scores of each player are saved and displayed using an API services.

I use npm and webpack to compile files and assets.
Also, I use Jest to test the functions created in this game.
